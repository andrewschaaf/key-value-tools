usage: kv-map [-h] --bash BASH [--temp-dir TEMP_DIR]

Apply a function to the stream.

Arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --bash BASH          The command that transforms each value. All substrings
                       "$VALUE_FILE" will be replaced by the single-quote-
                       escaped temp path for current value. All substrings
                       "$RESULT_FILE" will be replaced by the single-quote-
                       escaped temp path to which the command must write the
                       result. If "$VALUE_FILE" is not a substring of the
                       command, stdin will be used. If "$RESULT_FILE" is not a
                       substring of the command, stdout will be used.
  --temp-dir TEMP_DIR  Required iff you use "$VALUE_FILE" or "$RESULT_FILE".
                       The dir must already exist and its path must not
                       contain "'". Both requirements are verified.
